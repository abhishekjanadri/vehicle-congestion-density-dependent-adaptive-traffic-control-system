Today in India ,the Production in Automobile Industry is growing higher and higher when compared with the past few year. This indeed increases GDP of our country but the issue is accounted when the "Number of Vehicle on the lane increases day by day provided the capacity of the road is same ". This lead's to VCD i.e Vehicle Congestive Density.  Our team here proposes the effective method as a application of Digital Image Processing to control the departure period of the vehicle at the junction to control vechicle congestion depending on the vehicle congestive density at a particular lane.
